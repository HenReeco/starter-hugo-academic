I'm a fourth year Ph.D. Candidate conducting research on smart grids and development of machine learning techniques for power conservation. I provide data analysis expertise on animal health care prevention along with the development of ad-hoc algorithms. Additionally, I supervise undergraduate research for students in CPSlab. I aim to build a resume that allows me to pursue a career in academia.
