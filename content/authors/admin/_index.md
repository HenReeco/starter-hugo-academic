I'm a fifth year Ph.D. Candidate conducting research on AI-powered cyber-physical systems. I focus on several projects including power conservation systems in the context smart grids and inference of bovine respiratory disease in the context of precision farming. My technical background includes, among others, data analysis, machine learning pipelines, optimization techniques, and algorithm design. Additionally, I supervise graduate and undergraduate students in CPSlab, led by 
{{< staticref "http://silvestri.engr.uky.edu" "newtab" >}}Dr. Silvestri{{< /staticref >}}
, and I am the President of the Graduate Student Association of Computer Science (GSACS) at University of Kentucky.

<!-- employing auction theory and machine learning techniques. I also focus on algorithms for  using precision sensor technologies, as well as the prediction of soy bean crop yield.  -->

Currently looking for a postdoc position starting Summer 2023.
