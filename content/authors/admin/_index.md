I am an inter-disciplinary scientist with a PhD in Computer Science, focusing on AI-powered Cyber-Physical Systems. I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Animal Science Department led by Dr. Dorea. I work at the intersection of Cyber-Physical Systems and AI coupled with optimization techniques and algorithm design in order to achieve domain-specific objectives. Thus, I focus on accurate modeling of the system objectives, tradeoff analysis, and efficient data computation from heterogeneous and distributed sources.
<!-- , with a specific focus on the optimization of farm management decisions and improvement of animal nutrition and health.  -->
I have provided my computer science expertise and knowledge in several heterogenous domains and inter-disciplinary environments, thus collaborating with electrical engineers, psychological scientists, agricultural engineers, and animal scientists.

<!-- employing auction theory and machine learning techniques. I also focus on algorithms for  using precision sensor technologies, as well as the prediction of soy bean crop yield.  -->
