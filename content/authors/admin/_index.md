I'm a fifth year Ph.D. Candidate conducting research on power conservation systems in smart grids employing auction theory and machine learning techniques. I also focus on algorithms for the inference of bovine respiratory disease in dairy calves using precision sensor technologies, as well as the prediction of soy bean crop yield. Additionally, I supervise graduate and undergraduate students in CPSlab, and I am the President of the Graduate Student Association of Computer Science (GSACS) at University of Kentucky.
