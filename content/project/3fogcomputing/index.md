title: Fog Computing and Computation Offloading
summary: While the hardware capabilities for IoT devices is pushed by the industrial world, giving us smart rings and or Alexa-powered coffee machines, efficient software does not keep up well enough, and inefficient computations ends up affecting how the provides services affect the incredible hardware advancements.

With the widespread diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the possibility of computation, communication and connection to things and humans is higher than ever. While this opens a wide variety of services and enhanced activities, often the computation required to provide them is inefficient due to hardware limitations (e.g., small batteries) and limited use of software. With smarter ways to perform offloading in fog computing environments, both these problems can be solved.

Work in progress... stay tuned!
