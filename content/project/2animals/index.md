title: Animal Health Care Prevention
summary: Applying machine learning algorithms in the veterinary field can often gives access to insights that can provide early assessments about the health condition of animals. Just like it already happens for humans and pervasive devices, these assessments can not be considered medical devices and/or services. However, a successful early detection of symptoms, confirmed by a veterinarian, may often lead to faster healing when proper early treatment is provided.

Health care prevention starts from monitoring and activity recognition. Wearable devices are a great tool that allows pervasive monitoring and they allow the implementation of algorithms for efficient monitoring. I have carried out works that perform activity recognition on horses, and works for the prediction of bovine respiratory diseases from behavioral changes.
